# MXNet Notebooks


This repo contains various notebooks ranging from basic usages of MXNet to
state-of-the-art deep learning applications.

## How to use

### Python

The python notebooks are written in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).

- **View** We can view the notebooks on either
  [github](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet-notebooks/blob/master/python/outline.ipynb)
  or
  [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dmlc/mxnet-notebooks/blob/master/python/outline.ipynb). But
  note that the former may fail to render a page, while the latter has
  delays to view the recent changes.

- **Run** We can run and modify these notebooks if both [mxnet](http://mxnet.io/get_started/index.html#setup-and-installation) and [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) are
  installed. Here is an [example script](https://gist.github.com/mli/b64322f446b2043e3350ddcbfa5957be) to install all these packages on Ubuntu.

  If you have a AWS account, here is an easier way to run the notebooks:

  1.  Launch a g2.2xlarge or p2.2xlarge instance by using AMI `ami-fe217de9` on N. Virginia (us-east-1). This AMI is built by using  [this script](https://gist.github.com/mli/b64322f446b2043e3350ddcbfa5957be). Remember to open the TCP port 8888 in the security group.

  2.  Once the instance successfully launches, setup the following variables with proper values:

    ```bash
      export HOSTNAME=
      export PERM=
    ```

   3. Now, we should be able to ssh to the machine by

      ```bash
        chmod 400 $PERM
        ssh -i $PERM -L 8888:localhost:8888 ubuntu@HOSTNAME
      ```

      Here we forward the EC2 machine's 8888 port to local port 8888.

   4. Clone this repo on the EC2 machine and run jupyter

      ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet-notebooks
        jupyter notebook
      ```
   	  We can optional run `~/update_mxnet.sh` to update MXNet to the newest version.

   5. Now, we are able to view and edit the notebooks from the browser using the URL: http://localhost:8888/tree/mxnet-notebooks/python/outline.ipynb


### Scala

The scala notebooks are written in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) using [Jupyter-Scala Kernel V0.3.x](https://github.com/alexarchambault/jupyter-scala).

- **Run** We can run and modify these notebooks if both [mxnet scala package](http://mxnet.io/get_started/index.html#setup-and-installation), [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) and Jupyter-Scala Kernel are installed. There are various options for jupyter scala kernel. You can choose whichever you like.

  If you have a AWS account, here is an easier way to run the notebooks:

  1.  Launch a g2.2xlarge or p2.2xlarge instance by using AMI `ami-fe217de9` on N. Virginia (us-east-1). This AMI is built by using  [this script](https://gist.github.com/mli/b64322f446b2043e3350ddcbfa5957be). Remember to open the TCP port 8888 in the security group.

  2.  Once the instance successfully launches, setup the following variables with proper values:

    ```bash
      export HOSTNAME=
      export PERM=
    ```

   3. Now we should be able to ssh to the machine by

      ```bash
        chmod 400 $PERM
        ssh -i $PERM -L 8888:localhost:8888 ubuntu@HOSTNAME
      ```

      Here we forward the EC2 machine's 8888 port to local port 8888.

    4. Install [Maven](https://gist.github.com/sebsto/19b99f1fa1f32cae5d00). Install [Scala 2.11.8](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/scala-2.11.8.rpm). Go to MXNet source code, compile scala-package by running command `make scalapkg`. Compiled jar file will be created in `mxnet/scala-package/assembly/{your-architecture}/target` directory. 

    5. Install [coursier](https://github.com/coursier/coursier), a Scala library to fetch dependencies from Maven / Ivy repositories as follows.  

	    On OS X, `brew install --HEAD paulp/extras/coursier`
	    On Linux, 

	    ```bash
	      curl -L -o coursier https://git.io/vgvpD && chmod +x coursier && ./coursier --help
	    ```

	    Make sure coursier launcher is available in the PATH.

    6. Install [Jupyter-Scala Kernel V0.3.x](https://github.com/alexarchambault/jupyter-scala) by following the instructions given below: 

      ```bash
      	git clone https://github.com/alexarchambault/jupyter-scala.git
      	git checkout 0.3.x
      	./jupyter-scala
      ```

      To check if scala-kernel is installed, type command `jupyter kernelspec list`.

    7. Clone this repo on the EC2 machine and run jupyter

      ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet-notebooks
        jupyter notebook
      ```

    8. Now we are able to view and edit the notebooks from the browser using the URL: http://localhost:8888/tree/mxnet-notebooks/scala/. Choose scala211 kernel if asked. Include mxnet-scala jar created in step-4 in classpath by command `classpath.addPath("jar-path")` in the notebook you want to run.


## How to develop

Some general guidelines

- A notebook covers a single concept or application
- Try to be as basic as possible. Put advanced usages at the end, and allow reader to skip it.
- Keep the cell outputs on the notebooks so that readers can see the results without running
