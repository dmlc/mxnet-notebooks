# MXNet Notebooks

This repo contains various notebooks ranging from basic usages of MXNet to
state-of-the-art deep learning applications.

## How to use

### Python

The python notebooks are written in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/).

- **View** To view the notebooks on [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dmlc/mxnet-notebooks/blob/master/python/outline.ipynb).

- **Edit** You should be able to view and edit these notebooks if jupyter is installed.

## How to develope

Some general guidelines

- A notebook covers a single concept or application
- Try to be as basic as possible. Put advanced usages at the end, and allow reader to skip it.
- Keep the cell outputs on the notebooks so that readers can see the results without running
- Organize frequenlty asked questions on the [mxnet's issue](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/issues) into notebooks.
