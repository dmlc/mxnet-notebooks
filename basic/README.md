# Outline 

## Section-1
* NDArray: manipulating multi-dimensional array
* Symbol: symbolic expression for neural networks
* Module : intermediate-level and high-level interface for neural network training and inference.
* Loading data : feeding data into training/inference programs
* Mixed programming: developing training algorithms by using NDArray and Symbol together.

## Section-2
* MNIST: basic use case of MXNet based on the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset
* Optimizer: In gradient-base optimization algorithms, we update the parameters using the gradients in each iteration. We call this updating function as Optimizer.
* Image Data IO: how to prepare, load and train with image data in MXNet.
* Record IO: the python interface for reading and writing record io files.
